Explanation Document.IÕm not exactly sure as to what you want in this document so IÕll just do a quick explanation on why I made each file and what it does I suppose.To start off I made the app.py file, this is the workhorse file where the web app is actually ran from.  Here is where I defined the 4 routes which apply functionality to the page.After that I made the db and forms files as per the instructions. The db file handles my interaction with the database, i.e. creating my database, opening a connection. My forms.py just defines the Player Form fields, bat order, first_name, etc.The html files just create the visual skeleton for the webpage and css adds a bit of charcter.To run the application I run the app.py main in pycharm and then I visit the http://127.0.0.1:5000 local page to get it working.Although for some reason flask is no longer showing as working on my mac but everything seemed to work fine before so bombs away.
